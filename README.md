# TrendingRepos
A small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
I'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.29.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
